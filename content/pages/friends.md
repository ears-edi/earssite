I am a robotics engineer that used to help with workshops. I like building anything that moves. If I am not playing with 3D printers, I am probably playing games or sticking googly eyes on anything I can find.

I don't live in Edinburgh anymore, but if you want to chat about careers or have questions you can try [emailing me here](mailto:dweis7+ears@gmail.com) or messaging me on [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-weis/)
